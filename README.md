# c-chat
c-chat is a simple terminal chat program for GNU/Linux and iOS.

It allows a fairly large number of users to exchange text messages through a client/server architecture.
The project wants to be a simple, minimal alternative to popular chat services used in the workplace or to discuss common interests.

The implementation is entirely in C to keep the program efficient and small.

## Structure #

The source files directory contains 3 subdirectories:

* client - containing the source code for the client application.
* server - containing the source code for the server application.
* util - containing libraries and headers used in both the executables.

For further information refer to the documents in the "report/" directory.
