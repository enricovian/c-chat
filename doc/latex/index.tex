c-\/chat is a simple terminal chat program for G\+N\+U/\+Linux and i\+OS.

It allows a fairly large number of users to exchange text messages through a client/server architecture. The project wants to be a simple, minimal alternative to popular chat services used in the workplace or to discuss common interests.

The implementation is entirely in C to keep the program efficient and small.

\subsection*{Structure}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item client -\/ containing the source code for the client application.
\item server -\/ containing the source code for the server application.
\item util -\/ containing libraries and headers used in both the executables.
